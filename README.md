# Snippets

These are scripts and snippets that don't merit their own
repositories.  Pull it all and take what you like.  I have a bunch of
bits and pieces and I'll stick them here over time.

# Dependencies

I will put specific dependencies in the specific scripts, but util.py
is used by a few things, and that json_minify dependency seems to show
up in a bunch of things I write.  Grab it on GitHub: https://github.com/getify/JSON.minify/tree/python

# License

Unless otherwise specified in a specific file, everything in this repo
that I wrote is Affero GPL Version 3 or later.
